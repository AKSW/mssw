2011-10-05: Henry Story created [a video](http://vimeo.com/30014844) wich is a nice introduction to this project.

Since version 0.9.5-unstable-8 there is only one package which includes msw and mssw. There is no need to install two packages anymore and you can remove youre old "Semantic Web Core" (msw) package.

Since version 0.9.5 all packages are signed (also unstable), as the version in market.
So you should remove old installations, if you get problems installing the new versions.

On Tuesday 28th of September you could watch me presenting the Mobile Social Semantic Web at [SKIL 2010](http://skil.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/) ([program](http://skil.informatik.uni-leipzig.de/blog/programm/)) in the course of [INFORMATIK 2010](http://www.informatik2010.de/), the annual convention of the "Gesellschaft f√ºr Informatik".
